# Employee-Attrition---Neural-Netwrok
The Project investigates the factors that cause employee attrition in organizations. An Employee attrition model was built using moderate Neural Network Model and Random Forest. After generating common performance parameters for both the models, an Ensemble Model was created that identified the cause of employee attrition.
